## Overview and Usage
This tutorial document is designed to be used in Overleaf, but will work with any current version of TeXlive (Linux or Mac), MacTeX (Mac), or MikTeX (Windows). 
If you are compiling this document outside of Overleaf, please note that the minted package has an external dependency of [Pygments](https://pygments.org/), but Pygments is multiplatform and will work with Windows, Mac, or Linux.

This document demonstrates basic usage of a couple of LaTeX's importing packages.
1. [import](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/import)
2. [standalone](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/standalone)
3. [catchfilebetweentags](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/catchfilebetweentags)
